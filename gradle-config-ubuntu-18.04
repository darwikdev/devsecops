# How to Install Gradle on Ubuntu 18.04

# Gradle is a general-purpose build tool used primarily for Java projects. It combines the best features of Ant and Maven. Unlike its predecessors which use XML for scripting, Gradle uses Groovy, a dynamic, object-oriented programming language for the Java platform to define the project and build scripts.

# Prerequisites
-------------

# In order to be able to install packages on your Ubuntu system, you must be logged in as a user with sudo privileges.

# Installing Gradle on Ubuntu

# Gradle requires Java JDK or JRE version 7 or above to be installed. Weâ€™ll install OpenJDK 8.

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
$ java -version


2. Download Gradle
# At the time of writing this article, the latest version of Gradle is 5.0. Before continuing with the next step you should check the Gradle releases page to see if a newer version is available.

$ wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.0-bin.zip -P /tmp
$ sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle /tmp/gradle-*.zip
$ ls /opt/gradle/gradle-5.0 

3. Setup environment variable 

$ sudo leafpad /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh

# Paste the following configuration:

export GRADLE_HOME=/opt/gradle/gradle-5.0
export PATH=${GRADLE_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

$ sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh
$ source /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh


4. Verify the Gradle installation
To validate that Gradle is installed properly use the gradle -v command which will display the Gradle version:

$ gradle -v
